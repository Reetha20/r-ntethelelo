<h2>UNDERSTANDING MENTAL HEALTH</h2>

<p>Mental health is a fundamental human right that alters our feelings, thoughts and behavior.Our psychological, social, and emotional wellness are all parts that comprise our mental health.It also influences how we respond to stress, interact with people, and make sensible choices.And every stage of life, from infancy and adolescence to maturity, is critical for mental health.Furthermore, it is essential for socioeconomic, communal, and personal growth.

Beyond the lack of mental illnesses, mental health is more. It is experienced differently by each individual and lies on a complex continuum with various levels of difficulty and distress as well as having quite distinct social and therapeutic effects.

Mental health issues encompass a range of mental states and disorders, including psychosocial disabilities and mental disorders, that are linked to considerable suffering, impaired functioning, or self-harm risk. Although it's not always the case, people with mental health disorders are more likely to have lower levels of mental well-being.</p>
<br>
<p>Mental and physical health are closely related in that they are universal and require attention.

Being able to think, feel, and act in a manner that you need and desire to live your life is a sign of good mental health. However, if you have an era of poor mental health, you may find it difficult or even impossible to deal with the thoughts, feelings, or reactions you have on a regular basis. This may feel as awful or perhaps worse than a physical ailment.

In any given year, one in four persons experience mental health issues. These cover a wide spectrum of issues, from prevalent ones like anxiety and depression to uncommon ones like bipolar illness and schizophrenia. Having a mental health issue can be frightening, puzzling, and upsetting, especially at first. If you get sick, you can think that you're losing your mind
or that it's a display of weakness.

The unfavorable (and frequently unrealistic) portrayal of people with mental health issues on TV, in movies, and in the media frequently serves to confirm these anxieties. This can discourage you from asking for help or discussing your issues with others. This will therefore probably make you feel more distressed and alone.

But in actuality, mental health issues are a typical occurrence for people.</P>

<p>There are numerous kind of mental health issues. Since some of them share symptoms, you could get multiple diagnoses at once or have symptoms of multiple mental health issues. It is possible that you are struggling despite not having a specific diagnosis. Everybody has a unique experience, and it might evolve over time.</p>
<br>
<h3>Causes of mental health</h3>

<p>There are several possible reasons of mental health issues. Although some people may be more severely impacted by specific things than others, it's possible that many people are affected by a complex combination of elements.</p>
<br>
<p>*social exclusion or loneliness</p>
<p>*child maltreatment, neglect, trauma social exclusion,or loneliness</p>
<p>*facing prejudice and shame, such as racism poverty or debt grief (losing a dear one)</p>
<p>*a physical health problem that has persisted for a long time</p>
<p>*unemployment or job loss</p>
<p>*homelessness or substandard housing</p>
<p>*severe or prolonged stress</p>
<p>*having provided someone with long-term care</p>
<p>*Abuse of drugs and alcohol</p>
<p>*abuse at home; bullying or other forms of abuse as an adult</p>
<p>*substantial trauma suffered as an adult, such as battle in the military, involvement in a life-threatening event, or being the victim of a violent crime</p>
<p>*physical causes</p>
<br>
<h4>Treatment options</h4>

<p>There are varios ways of dealing with mental health and some of them includes:</p>

<p>*Self Help Plan</p>
<p>*Support Group</p>
<p>*Peer support</p>
<p>*Case Management</p>
<p>*Art therapy</P>

<p>Many people do recover from mental health issues, and it is possible to do so, particularly after receiving care. Periodically, your symptoms may resurface, but you'll be more comfortable handling them once you've figured out which self-care methods and therapies suit you the best.

Even if you're dealing with a more severe mental health issue, there are still strategies to help you control your symptoms. For many people, recovery is about discovering new ways to live their lives the way they want to and regaining control over elements of their lives that may have been out of control in the past, rather than necessarily going back to how things were.
But it's crucial to keep in mind that healing is a process, and it won't always be easy. It could be more beneficial for you to concentrate on self-discovery and coping mechanisms than on eliminating every symptom associated with your mental health issue. Your definition of recovery will be unique, but for the majority of people, the most crucial thing is to figure out how to live the kind of life they desire.</p>
